### How does Splitter know which variant to show?
We keep track of every impression for each variant. Based on this information, at least in Splitter v2, we would always show the least-shown variant when a new visitor arrives on your site.
This way, each variant in your experiment is almost exactly shown equally. 

However, there was **one major downside** with this approach.

The determination of which variant to show when a user visits your site needs to be fast. _Very fast_ in fact, because we cannot render the site before knowing which variant to show to a visitor. 
Imagine visiting a website only to see that a component is switched out for another one shortly after the page loaded. That would be a horrible UX.

This determinate way of figuring out our variant might look a bit nicer in the dashboard, but involves involves several steps and proved to be slow.

### How the decision making process works

Each variant is assigned a weight depending on the sum of variants in an experiment. The odds of each variant being shown are equal and will converge the more visits your site gets.

For example, assume we conduct an A/B-test for our landing page layout. Each layout would be shown with the following probability:

- Layout A, 33% chance
- Layout B, 33% chance
- Layout C, 33% chance

This approach allows us to respond to your users **almost instantly**, much faster than a determinate algorithm such as the one described above ever could. Of course, these probabilites only apply for new visitors. To ensure a consistent UX, returning visitors will always be shown the same variant within a 24-hour timeframe.
