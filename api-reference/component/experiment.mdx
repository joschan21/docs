title: 'Experiment'
---

The `<Experiment />` component is used to wrap a set of `<Variant />` components. It will randomly select one of the variants to render, unless the visitor is a returning visitor. In that case, the previously shown variant will be shown again within a 24-hour timeframe. 

The `<Experiment />` component will also send an event to the analytics service when a variant is selected and shown to your visitor, called an impression.
