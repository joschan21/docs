## 1. Sign in to your account

You can do so using either your email and password, Google or GitHub.

## 2. Create an experiment

Once you're logged in, you'll land in the Splitter dashboard. Click the green `Create Experiment` button in the top right corner.

  />
</Frame>

This will open a dialog. Give your experiment a name and click `create`.

## 3. Installation

Head over to the project you'd like to optimize and install the Splitter package.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title='npm'>
  ```bash
npm install splitter-gg 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title='npm'>
  ```bash
yarn add splitter-gg 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title='npm'>
  ```bash
pnpm install splitter-gg 
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4. Create your experiment variants

Now we define which React components we would like to A/B-test. Imagine the following scenarios:

- Changing the layout of your landing page
- Changing the call-to-action in your hero section
- Adding an onboarding flow to your SaaS to increase sales

All of these scenarios and many more can be realized with Splitter. Simply define your variants (i.e. different layouts for your landing page) and add them to your experiment.

Note: The experiment name of the `<Experiment>` component comes from step 2.

<Tip>

To avoid flickering or loading states, define your experiment inside of a Next.js 13 [server component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).

</Tip>

```typescript ServerComponent.tsx
import { Experiment, Variant } from 'splitter-gg'

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <Experiment name='your-experiment-name'>
      <Variant name='my-variant-1'>
        // any component here, i.e. landing page layout A
      </Variant>
      <Variant name='my-variant-2'>
        // any component here, i.e. landing page layout B
      </Variant>
    </Experiment>
  )
}
```

## 5. Add middleware

The Splitter middleware wraps standard [next.js middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) to ensure that your visitors always see the same variants during their visit, for example when navigating back and forth.

Simply wrap your existing middleware or create a new middleware file at the same level as your Next.js 13 `app` folder.

```
src/
  app/
  middleware.ts
```

```typescript middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { withSplitter } from 'splitter-gg/middleware'

export const middleware = withSplitter(() => {
  // your Next.js middleware, for example:
  return NextResponse.next()
})

export const config = {
  // include your a/b testing route(s) here
  matcher: ['/'],
}
```

## 6. Create your API key

We're almost done! All that's left is creating your API key.

To create your key, click your user symbol on the very right side of the navbar.
This will open up a dropdown with the option `API keys`.

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src='https://utfs.io/f/7895dc9e-251e-45b9-bbc6-deaffdb784ee-d98j4k.png'
  />
</Frame>

On the API key page, hit `Create Key` in the top right corner.

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src='https://utfs.io/f/16b5f3b5-0c9b-4181-9385-c06d5546f859-p1kpwv.png'
  />
</Frame>

After creating your key and giving it an optional name, paste it into a `.env` file living in the root of your Next.js project.

```bash .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLITTER_KEY=...
```

## You're all set ðŸŽ‰

That's it! You're all set to optimize your website. As you develop locally, you'll notice metrics appearing in your experiment dashboard.
Once you've verified everything is working correctly, you can disable the local tracking - [see our API reference]().

Also, you can [start tracking clicks]() and [start tracking conversions]().
