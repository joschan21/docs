description: How can I track events that are not conversions?
---

Splitter allows you the flexibility to track clicks. Clicks are events that should not count as a conversion, but represent the user taking a core step in that direction. This allows you to monitor and improve your CTR, for example in the following use cases:

- Tracking clicks on your newsletter sign-up button
- Tracking clicks on your "Contact me" button
- Tracking clicks on your "Download my CV" button
- Tracking clicks on your "Buy now" button

These are not quite conversions, because a visitor clicking your "contact me" button does not automatically mean they will also submit the contact form.

## Start tracking clicks

```typescript ClientComponent.tsx
'use client'
import { useSplitter } from 'splitter-gg/client'

const ClientComponent = () => {
  const { trackClick } = useSplitter()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => trackClick('your-experiment-name')}>Buy now</button>
  )
}
```
